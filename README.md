# Homework-5 
This homework tasks the student with developing a day planner using given code. The planner should store data to localStorage to be 
retrieved when the application is loaded again. 
# Actual Functionality
The Clear Entries button clears everything in localStorage, then reloads the page.
The Save All Entries button iterates through the table saving each applicable data
entry.
The Save Entry buttons save individual hourly entries, but they do not alter data in 
any other cells.
